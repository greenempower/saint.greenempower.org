		<h1>Saints of The Green Empower Organization</h1>

		<p>Saints directory of The Green Empower Organization.</p>

		<p>In my mind we will define and designate saints (or some iteration of concept).</p>

        <p>Our saints will be people who take our values core values and live then.</p>

        <p>I think we should try to avoid ranking saints in terms of their innate abilities.</p>

        <p>More important is that they are take our values to heart and live them.</p>

        <p>I'm thinking that our sainthood should be more of an internal characterization rather than something we try to put on people who may not be interested.</p>

        <p>I Holden Green at this time would like to make myself a saint of Green Empower.</p>
